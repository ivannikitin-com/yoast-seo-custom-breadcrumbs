![banner](assets/banner-772x250.jpg)

This plugin allows for custom breadcrumbs to be set up for any individual page/post/product in Wordpress 
or for WooCommerce Product Categories.

> :warning: **Important!**: This plugin assumes that breadcrumbs are formed using the
> [Yoast SEO Plugin](https://ru.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

This plugin will not be able to modify breadcrumbs on your site if they are generated by the theme or any custom code.

## Plugin Installation

1. Download the latest version of the plugin [using this link](https://github.com/ivannikitin-com/yoast-seo-custom-breadcrumbs/releases/latest) as a zip file and install it in the standard way in WordPress Plugins -> Add New -> Upload File.
2. Activate the plugin.

## Using the Plugin

To generate breadcrumbs, the plugin uses pre-created menus. Therefore, create single-level menus with the desired links to any elements of your site or even external links and save this menu (or these menus) with an arbitrary name.

For this:

1. In the site admin, open Appearance -> Menus.
2. Click on the link "create a new menu."
3. In the menu name field, enter "Breadcrumbs 1" (We recommend always naming the menu Breadcrumbs).
4. Don't set any menu settings checkboxes!
5. Click the "Create Menu" button.
6. In the left column, check the boxes for any items (pages, posts, categories, etc., including custom links!) and click "Add to Menu" to add them to the right column "Menu Structure."
7. If you expand the added item (arrow on the right), you can specify custom text for it or remove it.
8. If necessary, the order of items can be changed by dragging and dropping. Do not create nested items! The menu should be single-level!
9. Save your work by clicking "Save" in the bottom right corner.

Go to any item type like Page, Post, or Product, and in the "Breadcrumbs" meta box, select the predefined menu.

For this:

1. Find the section (meta box) named "Breadcrumbs" (likely at the bottom).
2. Choose the menu you created from the dropdown list.
3. Click the "Update Post/Page/Product" button (usually at the top-right).
4. Click on the link "View."

Check out how the breadcrumbs are displayed on the site.

If the item has the "Default" value selected, then the breadcrumbs formed by Yoast SEO will be used.
